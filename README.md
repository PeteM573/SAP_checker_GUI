# SAP_checker_GUI
A simple webapp that tess mock export data for researching theoretical variances in. While this is based on the output of an SAP system, it does not use any actual output - just a receipt or repair number generated at random and SAP movement codes taken from SAP's own documentation.

DO NOT use this to actually research variances! <br>1: It's working with incomplete mock data. <br>2: It would be ridiculously stupid to just run a python script you found on GitHub to try to make variance research go faster. <br>3: I'm purposefully not including a lot of things that a real employee would make use of, because I want to prevent 2.

<br>If someone at my former employee wants to give me a ton of money to take this idea and make it actually functional, then I can be reached on linkedin. :p
